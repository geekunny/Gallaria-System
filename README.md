# Minor-1 Project
The project aims at solving the NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization. In this problem, a list of items is given by the customer and the task is to find the shortest route to visit each block of items exactly once and return to the starting position with total distance travelled and the shortest route.

To solve the problem, we are going to use one of the best path-finding algorithms, Floyd-Warshall Algorithm as we found it suitable for this task as it returns the distance between all pairs of nodes.
Floyd-Warshall Algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest path between all the pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. This algorithm works for both the directed and undirected weighted graphs. 
In this algorithm, we are assuming categories as our Nodes and the distance between each department of category as the weights for the edges and hence we will proceed in this algorithm.
